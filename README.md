# emotional_dynamics_modeling

Simulation of emotional states through mathematical models based on
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).

This project explores how emotions evolve under:
- natural decay,
- external forcing,
- nonlinear internal regulation,
- interaction between emotional states.

All models are mathematically defined, analytically solved, and simulated
in Python. Plots and report included.
